# deep-learning-power-study

## Goal
Our goal is to cover: 
1. Neural network 
2. Deep Neural Network 
3. Applied work

We will focus more on applied work compared to theories.

## Outline
We will cover two books (both available in this git repo):
1. Deep Learning With Python (2018)
2. Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow (2017)

<i>Since our goal is to cover deep learning primarily, we will start off with "Deep Learning with Python". Then we will cover few relevant chapters from "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow".</i>

## Chapters
1. All chapters from "Deep Learning with Python"
2. Part II chapters from "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow"

## Resources
1. Explanatory code in Jupyter Notebook from "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow": https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml
2. Collection of books on Machine learning (including Deep Learning): https://github.com/quincyliang/machine-learning-books
3. Cornell CS Machine Learning Course:
